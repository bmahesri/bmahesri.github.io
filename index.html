      <h3>Bride of Karsaz</h3>
      <a href="https://bmahesri.itch.io/the-bride-of-karsaz">Play here</a>
      <p>Inspired by a tragic urban legend and the equally haunting traffic of Karachi, Pakistan.</p>
      <p>In this prototype, I reimagined an urban myth about a bride and her groom who died on Karsaz Road on the evening of their wedding. Her restless soul is said to haunt the road to this day, seeking revenge on unsuspecting passersby during the dead of night.</p>
      <p>I created this game prototype over the span of 2 weeks as an individual project, using C# and Unity. The prototype features a tense and atmospheric setting where players must navigate through chaotic urban traffic while avoiding the brideâ€™s pursuit.</p>
